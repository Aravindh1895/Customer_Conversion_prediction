# Customer_Conversion_prediction
Objective is to build a  predictive model for an insurance company to determine customer behaviour in buying a product. The XG-Boost algorithm outperformed other models in terms of AUROC score and F1 score. The dataset was pre-processed, balanced using SMOTE-NN, and the model was fitted to make accurate predictions on new data.
